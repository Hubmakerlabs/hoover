# Arweave AO Social Hoover Project

## Milestones

### Milestone 1:

#### Technical Specification Document  & Proof of Concept

(4 weeks)

##### Analyze the data structures of Nostr, Bluesky and Farcaster

- Devise a data structure layout that takes into account for all of the specific details of each protocolâ€™s message types, enabling all protocol data to be stored validly in Arweave while maintaining the ability to reconstitute the original for cryptographic verification

- Build bidirectional data conversion functions (for validation of conversion) and test them

- Build basic event retrieval functions for rudimentary hoovering of posts from their native sources (Nostr, Bluesky and Farcaster) within a time window

#### Milestone 2:

##### Full-Scale Data Hoover

(4 weeks)

- Spider services that pull the events from the social network data sources at reasonable frequency (5-10 seconds interval) for Nostr, Bluesky and Farcaster

- An ao smart contract that given an Arweave-formatted social media post, that can convert it to its canonical (for signing) form (Nostr, Bluesky, and Farcaster) and verify the signatures of the native data within the smart contract
